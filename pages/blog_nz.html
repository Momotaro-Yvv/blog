        <h2>2019-2020 Gap Year in New Zealand</h2>
        <h6>
            Momotaro, Dec 2 2021
        </h6>
        <p>
            The time I spend in New Zealand is one of the most special experiences and turing point of my lifetime. </br>
            For those who love nature and slow pace of life, it is abosolutely one of the best options for traveling and living.
            On the very first day I arrived New Zealand Auckland Airport, I bought an air ticket straight to Queenstown, and started my journey of exploration there. It was there I decide to give myself some extra time to figure things out rather than rush into any workplace I have no passion on. </br>
            It was also here in NZ I met my Mr.right, and together with him, we travelled to most places on north island(much more to explore on south island), helped on farms in exchange for accomodations and food, dog sitting Maru the naughty puppy, and waitting Lucy to give birth to seven Sky Terrier puppies on 2020 Christmas night!

           Just as the lyrics in a song said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Whatever Will Be Will Be<br>
                The future's not ours to see
            </p>
            <footer>
                â€” Que Sera, Sera,
                <cite>Doris Day</cite>
            </footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It's been undoubtedly a tough time for everyone during the pandamic, while all we can do is do our best with what we are capable of, cherish the time and those people we love around us, and leave the rest to the fate.
            </br>
